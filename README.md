# binarysearch

This set of programs and scripts asks user some questions and guesses their number.

### C
To run this C program, you need gcc and make. You can always compile it without make by using (in 'c' folder)
```sh
$ gcc -o binarysearch code/make.c code/binsort.c
```
### Java
I already compiled Java. To run the app, cd to build and use 
```sh
$ java binarysearch.BinarySearch
```
Also make sure you *have* it installed.

### JavaScript
There's a class that returns the result after a few confirmation dialogues. You just need to add script tag, create a new BinarySearch object and get guessed number using guess(). You can also use html file for demo.
